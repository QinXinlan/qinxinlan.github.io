## ðŸŽ“ What we know ðŸŽ“

### Every blink is different

Of course, your blinks will differ from those of your friends, family, or a stranger on the street. But more importantly, each spontaneous blink you make is unique.

How so?

Because every time you spontaneously close your eyes, the upper eyelid doesn't need to fully descend to lubricate your eyeball or pause your attention. So it just doesn't. 

The upper eyelid is lazy like this.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/brownian-motion.gif" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Also, quick side note for the Bell's phenomenon fans out there. If you don't press your eyeball with your finger when blinking, it won't move. The effects of blinks in EEG signals are primarily caused by the muscular activity associated with the movement of the upper eyelid [{% cite IWASAKI2005878 %}, {% cite nakano2013blink %} ].

### Your blinks propagate on your head

Well, thanks Sherlock. How is that of interest?

Because we know how a blink _should_ propagate, with a smooth and gradual attenuation from the frontal electrodes (closest to the eyes) to the occipital electrodes. When this pattern deviates, we can identify a faulty electrode.

## ðŸ¤” What we don't know (yet) ðŸ¤”

### Is it _your_ head?

Can we use blinks to identify people? 

Probably. The characteristics of blink propagation seem like a good starting point.


### Why do you call a blink a pulsar?

With their easy to detect shape and well-known characteristics, blinks could serve a a calibration tool. One of the only signal that seem stable across sessions. 


### What happens when something new appears during a blink?

I'm guessing the brain goes "Aaaaaaaaaah". But more importantly, is _when_ is it processed? Just to be sure, we do not mistake it with another signal or task. 


### Are there differences between blind and non-blind people?

Still only talking about blinks.
