## ðŸŽ“ What we know ðŸŽ“

### Every blink is different.

Of course, your blinks will differ from those of your friends, family, or a stranger on the street. But more importantly, each spontaneous blink you make is unique.

How so?

Because every time you spontaneously close your eyes, the upper eyelid doesn't need to fully descend to lubricate your eyeball or pause your attention. So it just doesn't. 

The upper eyelid is lazy like this.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/brownian-motion.gif" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Also, quick side note for the Bell's phenomenon fans out there. If you don't press your eyeball with your finger when blinking, it won't move. The effects of blinks in EEG signals are primarily caused by the muscular activity associated with the movement of the upper eyelid [{% cite IWASAKI2005878 %}, {% cite nakano2013blink %} ].

### Your blinks propagate on your head.

Well, thanks Sherlock. How is that of interest?

Because we know how a blink _should_ propagate, with a nice and easy attenuation from the frontal electrodes (closest to the eyes) to the occipital electrodes. So when it doesn't, we know there is a faulty electrode.

### Is it _your_ head?
