      "summary": "Channel selection is a critical part of the classification procedure for multichannel electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI). An optimized subset of electrodes reduces computational complexity and optimizes accuracy. Different tasks activate different sources in the brain and are characterized by distinctive channels. The goal of the current review is to define a subset of electrodes for each one of four popular BCI paradigms: motor imagery, motor execution, steady-state visual evoked potentials and P300. Twenty-one studies have been reviewed to identify the most significant activations of cortical sources. The relevant EEG sensors are determined from the reported 3D Talairach coordinates. They are scored by their weighted mean Cohen’s d and its confidence interval, providing the magnitude of the corresponding effect size and its statistical significance. Our goal is to create a knowledge-based channel selection framework with a sufficient statistical power. The core channel selection (CCS) could be used as a reference by EEG researchers and would have the advantages of practicality and rapidity, allowing for an easy implementation of semiparametric algorithms.",

      "summary": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are constantly superimposed with biological artifacts. In particular, spontaneous blinks represent a recurrent event that cannot be easily avoided. The main goal of this paper is to present a new algorithm for blink correction (ABC) that is adaptive to inter- and intra-subject variability. The whole process of designing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based EEG experiment is highlighted. From sample size determination to classification, a mixture of the standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for source localization and time restriction, followed by Riemannian geometry classifiers is featured. Comparison between ABC and the commonly-used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for blinks removal shows a net amelioration with ABC. With the same pipeline using uncorrected data as a reference, ABC improves classification by 5.38% in average, whereas ICA deteriorates by −2.67%. Furthermore, while ABC accurately reconstructs blink-free data from simulated data, ICA yields a potential difference up to 200% from the original blink-free signal and an increased variance of 30.42%. Finally, ABC's major advantages are ease of visualization and understanding, low computation load favoring simple real-time implementation, and lack of spatial filtering, which allows for more flexibility during the classification step.",

      "summary": "This paper represents a first attempt to perform a priori sample size determination from a “historic” Electroencephalography (EEG) dataset. The importance of adequate sample size is firstly highlighted, and evidence is given against the use of normal distribution for such computations when the data cannot be assumed to be Gaussian. The “historic” dataset is then thoroughly examined to determine the least less likely underlying distribution for the desired phenomenon, in this case, the spontaneous blinks potential. Two Monte Carlo simulations, using different distribution assumptions, are subsequently computed to estimate the a priori minimum sample size. Finally, these choices are discussed considering practical limitations, as well as the computational differences for other phenomena to study. ",

This Algorithm for Blink Correction (ABC) directly corrects the signal in the time domain without the need for additional Electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes. The main idea is to automatically adapt to the blink's inter-and intra-subject variability by considering the blink's amplitude as a parameter. A simple Minimum Distance to Riemannian Mean (MDRM) is applied as the classification algorithm. Preliminary results on three subjects show a mean classification accuracy increase of 13.7% using ABC.",

To our knowledge, it is the first time that such an adaptive method aimed at blink correction is designed. Existing methods for the correction of ocular artifacts are mostly based on the assumption of a component model, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The results of two ICA-based methods are compared to ABC while using a free-blink EEG to which are added models of different amplitudes of blinks.\n",

      "summary": "Current Brain-Computer Interfaces mostly use P300, Visual Evoked Potential, Slow Cortical Potential or Sensorimotor rhythms as control signals to provide a new non-muscular channel for communication and control to the external world. However, the recorded EEG signals are still weak, hard to acquire and of poor quality. These limitations result in an incompatible accuracy rate with real-life applications. To decrease the error rate while bounding the rate of false positives on a single-trial analysis, the subject’s frustration can be used as a neuro-feedback to detect errors. In this study, we try to characterize differences between frustration and contentment as a way to detect errors in order to enhance the accuracy rate and the usability of the P300 speller.",
