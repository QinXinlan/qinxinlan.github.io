  abstract = {Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are constantly superimposed with biological artifacts. In particular, spontaneous blinks represent a recurrent event that cannot be easily avoided. The main goal of this paper is to present a new algorithm for blink correction (ABC) that is adaptive to inter- and intra-subject variability. The whole process of designing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based EEG experiment is highlighted. From sample size determination to classification, a mixture of the standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for source localization and time restriction, followed by Riemannian geometry classifiers is featured. Comparison between ABC and the commonly-used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for blinks removal shows a net amelioration with ABC. With the same pipeline using uncorrected data as a reference, ABC improves classification by 5.38% in average, whereas ICA deteriorates by −2.67%. Furthermore, while ABC accurately reconstructs blink-free data from simulated data, ICA yields a potential difference up to 200% from the original blink-free signal and an increased variance of 30.42%. Finally, ABC's major advantages are ease of visualization and understanding, low computation load favoring simple real-time implementation, and lack of spatial filtering, which allows for more flexibility during the classification step.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
