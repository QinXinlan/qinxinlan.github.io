abstract = {Objective: 
To characterize the effects of the eyeball and eyelid positions during eyeblinks on electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials.
Methods:
Movements of the upper eyelids and eyes were measured in two healthy subjects using the magnetic search coil technique during horizontal and vertical eye rotations, eyeblinks, and lid closure. Corresponding signal changes were recorded simultaneously on the electroencephalogram (EEG).
Results:
Spontaneous blinks produced small eye movements directed down and inward, whereas slow or forced blinks were associated with delayed upward eye rotations (i.e. Bell's phenomenon); both types of blinks caused positive EEG potentials with bifrontal distribution maximum at Fp1 and Fp2.
Conclusions:
In prior reports, these positive EEG artifacts have been attributed to upward eyeball rotation during blinks—Bell's phenomenon. By contrast, our findings indicate that movements of the eyelid contribute to a greater extent to these EEG potentials than do upward eyeball rotations.
Significance:
Care is required in attributing EEG artifacts to movements of either eyeball or eyelid, since our findings suggest that they both contribute to these potentials.}

abstract = {It remains unknown why we generate spontaneous eyeblinks every few seconds, more often than necessary for ocular lubrication. Because eyeblinks tend to occur at implicit breakpoints while viewing videos, we hypothesized that eyeblinks are actively involved in the release of attention. We show that while viewing videos, cortical activity momentarily decreases in the dorsal attention network after blink onset but increases in the default-mode network implicated in internal processing. In contrast, physical blackouts of the video do not elicit such reciprocal changes in brain networks. The results suggest that eyeblinks are actively involved in the process of attentional disengagement during a cognitive behavior by momentarily activating the default-mode network while deactivating the dorsal attention network.}
